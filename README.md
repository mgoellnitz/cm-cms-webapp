CoreMedia Content Management Server
===================================

Demo gradle script to assemble a plain, uncustomized CoreMedia Content Management 
server in a stripped down variant of how the original Maven based workspace layout 
from CoreMedia does it.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Access to the CoreMedia Maven artifact repositories

- A valid license file

- A prepared (MySQL) database

Usage
-----

Customizing

Change the values in the few config files presented in this workspace as needed. 
E.g. the database access definetely needs some tuning. Add a license file license.zip to the properties/corem directory.

Building

```
gradle build
```

Running

It is not possible to start a CoreMedia Content Server as a WAR-Package. It needs 
to be exploded. I was not able to achieve this with the gradle tomcat module referenced 
by the build.gradle script in this workspace. You will definetely have to copy the 
created artifact to a tomcat container to be able to start it.

```
mv build/libs/coremedia.war /some/where/my/tomcat/resides/webapps
```

DB preparation steno
====================

Create ab account with http://www.db4free.net/ and integrate the access data into 
the sql.properties in this workspace.
